Programming language used for Lab 1 is C++
To re-run the code, you must have a c++ compiler 

For Question 1 , only run main.cpp file to generate 1000 exponential variables
open a linux terminal, Make sure your directory is the same location where you saved 
main.cpp
Event.h
Event.cpp
DES.cpp
makefile

and type the following on the command line:

g++ main.cpp                -- press enter
./a.out						-- press enter


DISCLAIMER: 
Please make sure that your device has at least 8gb of free memory 
If not, the program will terminate the simulation.



To run the code that runs the simulation for M/M/1 Queue , open the DES.cpp file using 
an Editor , such as Notepad++ and comment line 239 and Un-comment line 238
save the file and open the terminal as previously explained. 

Enter the following on the command line 

make -f makefile

To run the code that runs the simulation for M/M/1/K Queue
open the DES.cpp file using
