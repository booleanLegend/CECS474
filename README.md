# CECS474
Computer Network Interoperability with Dr. Haixia Peng

This repo includes 2 labs (we were supposed to do 3, however, we didn't have enough time to do them so the professor updated this kindly), including hw assignments and the lecture slides. The labs were difficult and we relied heavily on other open source repos to complete them. The midterm and the final were also difficult. While the course was curved overall, I still ended up with a B, even though we got a 99 and a 100 on Lab 1 and 2 respectively and my hw assignments were in the high 80's.
